Happy hacking! ðŸ¥³

## Quick notes

-   Regenerate auto-generated types after changing graphql-related code:
    -   On the client-side (Apollo Client): `pnpm apollo:watch`
    -   In the schema folder (Nexus): `pnpm nexus:watch` (Doesn't appear to do anything right now -> just run the dev server `pnpm dev` in the background)
    -   In the `schema.prisma` file (Prisma): `pnpm prisma:watch`
    -   **Regenerate everything**: `pnpm generate` (once) / `pnpm watch` (until killed)
-   Restart the `ESLint language server` from the VSCode command palette after changing graphql-related code **AND** regenerating the automated typings
